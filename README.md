# The ALKB Curator

## Project Overview

**The ALKB Curator** is a Python project designed to build a dynamic, secure, and compliant knowledge base for AI systems. The project ensures that AI interactions are precise, regulated, and enhanced by expert contributions, creating an evolving knowledge base that adapts to changing business and regulatory needs.

### Key Features:

- **Insightful AI Interactions**: Tailor AI responses to fit your specific business context.
- **Compliance & Security**: Ensure all data meets regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and is stored securely.
- **Expert Contributions**: Easily incorporate expert feedback to prioritize and enhance the AI knowledge base.
- **Knowledge Base Evolution**: Seamlessly update the knowledge base as regulations or business needs change.
- **Data Integrity**: Robust security mechanisms to safeguard your knowledge base and monitor interactions.

## Installation

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ALKB-Curator.git
cd ALKB-Curator
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment to isolate your project’s dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- On Windows:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using \`pip\`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Configuration

### Compliance Rules

To set up compliance rules, modify the \`compliance_rules\` parameter in the \`ComplianceChecker\` class. You can specify any regulation or policy your system must adhere to, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or internal corporate policies.

For example:

```python
compliance_rules = ["GDPR", "HIPAA", "Internal Policy"]
compliance_checker = ComplianceChecker(compliance_rules)
```

### Security Configuration

In \`utils/security.py\`, you can configure encryption methods to secure the knowledge base. This project uses placeholder methods for encryption and monitoring, but you can replace them with actual security frameworks like AES encryption from the \`cryptography\` library.

---

## Usage

### Step 1: Curating Knowledge

Use the \`KnowledgeCurator\` to curate and update your knowledge base.

```python
from knowledge_base.curator import KnowledgeCurator
from knowledge_base.knowledge_manager import KnowledgeManager
from knowledge_base.compliance_checker import ComplianceChecker

# Initialize components
compliance_rules = ["GDPR", "HIPAA"]
compliance_checker = ComplianceChecker(compliance_rules)
knowledge_manager = KnowledgeManager()
curator = KnowledgeCurator(knowledge_manager, compliance_checker)

# Curate and update knowledge
new_data = {
    # Your new incoming data
}
curated_data = curator.curate_knowledge(new_data)
```

### Step 2: Handling Expert Contributions

You can gather expert feedback to refine and prioritize the knowledge base.

```python
from knowledge_base.expert_contributor import ExpertContributor

contributor = ExpertContributor()
expert_refined_data = contributor.gather_expert_feedback(new_data)
```

### Step 3: Checking Compliance

Ensure that incoming data meets regulations before updating the knowledge base.

```python
if compliance_checker.is_compliant(new_data):
    print("Data is compliant!")
else:
    print("Data does not meet regulatory standards.")
```

---

## Testing

Unit tests are provided to ensure that each component of the system works as expected.

### Running Tests

You can run tests using \`pytest\`:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

Example tests include:

- **Curator Tests**: Ensure the curator correctly updates the knowledge base.
- **Knowledge Manager Tests**: Check if data transformation and storage are correct.
- **Compliance Checker Tests**: Validate that the system catches non-compliant data.
